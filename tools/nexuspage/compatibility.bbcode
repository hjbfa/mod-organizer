The Mod Organizer works with almost any tool I've tried so far. What this means is that they can be made to work on the "virtual" data tree.
Among the tested applications are: obmm, fomm, TES Construction Set, GECK, TES4LODGen, TES4Edit, FO3Edit, BOSS, Fake Fullscreen (Oblivion and Fallout), Skyrim 4GB.
Wrye Bash and Fallout Variants of it are a bit more difficult. They only work if you're using a 32-bit python or the standalone version.

Please note that these tools will write to the actual data directory (i.e. fomm installing a mod, GECK saving a plugin). These file are then not under the control of MO.

MO is compatible to Script Extenders insofar as they work alongside each other. However, if you're using "Script Extender" as the load mechanism (see above) you cannot install *se plugins in MO because *SE loads its plugin before MO even gets activated to create the virtual data-directory.
